# topic-qna-generation
An LLM project to generate topics and topic wise questions from a pdf.
The notebooks contain the install instructions for the setup.
Used langchain and ollama mainly for the project.
The command below 
```bash
ollama serve
```
needs to be running in a separate terminal after downloading and installing ollama from the notebook.
Rest of the instructions can be run directly from the notebook.
